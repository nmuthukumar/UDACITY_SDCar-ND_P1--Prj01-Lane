### Goals of the Project
The Goals / Steps of this Project are the following:
- Make a Pipeline that Finds Lane Lines [Left & Right] on the Road from the given Input Images and Videos,  
  and Annotate the detected Lane Lines with:
  - Stage-1: Line Segments
  - Stage-2: Solid Lines (Extrapolated Single Line based on the Line Segments to map out the Full Extent of the Lane Boundaries)
- Reflect on the Project Work in a written Report.

### How To Execute the Code in this Project
- Step 1: Set up the [UDACITY CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/)

- Step 2: Open the Code in a *Jupyter Notebook*
  
  To start Jupyter in your Browser, use Terminal to navigate to your Project Directory and then  
  Run the following Command at the Terminal Prompt  
  (Be sure you've Activated your Python 3 `carnd-term1` Environment  
  as described in the `CarND Term1 Starter Kit` Installation Instructions!):
  ```
      > jupyter notebook
  ```
  
  A Browser Window will appear showing the Contents of the Current Directory.  
  Click on the File called `"P1.ipynb"`.  
  Another Browser Window will appear displaying the Notebook.

- Step 3: Execute the Project Code
  
  1. Read the Instructions and Comments in the Notebook.
  2. Feature Switches:  
     Enable/Disable the Feature Switches and Development Feature Switches as required before execution.
  3. Parameters:  
     Note the Parameter Values of each of the Functions, read the corresponding Comments, and alter as required before execution.

Enjoy! :-)
